	 *	@brief calculates tha block matrix split by block sizes
	 *
	 *	This works in a few steps. First, the block row and block column sizes are recorded.
	 *	Then, a permutation of block rows and columns is constructed, so that blocks of each
	 *	particular size are in contiguous submatrices. Some empty space may need to be inserted
	 *	to align the top left block in each of those submatrices to the multiple of the block
	 *	size. E.g. if the matrix has a single 3x3 block and a single 4x4 block, there needs to
	 *	be a 1x1 block inserted after the 3x3 block so that the 4x4 block starts at row and
	 *	column which are multiple of four. Finally, the submatrices are split to several separate
	 *	block matrices in the output array.
	 *
	 *	Note that this process increases the bandwidth of the matrix, which hurts performance
	 *	on very long vectors where the data need to be fetched from RAM. This is not a flaw of
	 *	this implementation but rather a principal flaw of the splitting method.
	 *
	 *	@param[out] r_split_matrix is filled with a list of block matrices that sum up to
	 *		the original matrix, each containing only blocks of a single size (the blank
	 *		space is also divided to this size, to accomodate the BSR format)
	 *	@param[out] r_perm_layout is filled with block row and column layout of the split
	 *		matrix, which is used for permuting the lhs and rhs vectors (has no nonzeros)
	 *	@param[out] r_block_row_perm is filled with block row permutation required by splitting
	 *	@param[out] r_block_col_perm is filled with block column permutation required by splitting
	 *	@param[out] r_n_row_ext is the number of (scalar) rows that needed to be added to
	 *		the matrix in order to align the first block of each particulat size
	 *	@param[out] r_n_col_ext is the number of (scalar) columns that needed to be added to
	 *		the matrix in order to align the first block of each particulat size
	 *	@param[in] r_block_mat is the block matrix to split
	 *
