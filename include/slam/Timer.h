/**
 *	@brief timer sampler object
 *
 *	We are intersting in sampling a timer and measuring performance of pieces of code.
 *	In our application, those are usually structures as some total time + breakdown of
 *	the individual stages of the algorithm (possibly even in a tree structure).
 *
 *	The general requirements are:
 *		- need to use a single timer sample for subsequent events
 *		- need to be able to easily disable it, without causing a mess in the code
 *		- don't want crazy macros that would mess the code up
 *
 *	Possible problems:
 *		- time of some phase is not calculated correctly (e.g. the phase was split
 *		  and incorrect timer samples are being subtracted)
 *		- total time is not summed up correctly
 *		- thanks to code branching, time is not calculated correctly
 *		- thanks to premature exit (return, break), time is not calculated correctly
 *
 *	This can be used in analogous fashion to Matlab's tic() and toc(), without using
 *	the sissy names.
 *
 *	This would be used as follows:
 *	@code
 *	CTimer timer; // a global timer object (don't want to construct many of those, want to share it)
 *	double f_time_a = 0, f_time_b = 0; // time spent in different parts of the algorithm
 *	double f_total_time; // total time (we want to represent it explicitly to avoid later mistakes)
 *
 *	CTimerSampler tic(timer); // timing starts here
 *	AlgorithmPartA();
 *	tic.Accum_DiffSample(f_time_a); // like a "toc" and a next "tic"
 *	AlgorithmPartB();
 *	tic.Accum_DiffSample(f_time_b); // like a "toc"
 *	tic.Accum_CumTime_LastSample(f_total_time); // does not imply a sample (the last sample is used)
 *	@endcode
 *
 *	To measure in a tree structure, one would need a stackable timer sampler (problems with
 *	threading and many additional issues with correct timing). Instead, one can use more timer
 *	sampler objects in a stacked fashion (the measurements of inner phases will not fit perfectly
 *	with the outer phase, thanks to double timer samples - no good way around that). Could
 *	add functions like Fork() and Join() to support explicit hierarchy of the timed stages.
 *
 *	It is also easy to make a void sampler class, which will not touch the referenced variables,
 *	effectively optimizing all the timing code away (but the variables themselves must remain
 *	in place, see CVoidTimerSampler).
 *
 *	This solves correct summation of the total time and algorithm stages.
 *
 *	Problems with the total time and branching / early exit could be solved by passing a reference
 *	to the total time variable in the constructor, and the destructor would accumulate the cummulative
 *	time automatically. This assumes that the scope of the sampler is correctly limited and that
 *	the last sample is properly sampled (cumtime does not imply sampling). Probably causes more
 *	problems than it solves.
 *
 *	Another approach (possibly more efficient) would be to declare the timed periods
 *	as global objects. That could look like this:
 *
 *	@code
 *	CTimer timer;
 *	CTimerSampler<CMakeTypelist(part_a, part_b)> algorithm_time;
 *
 *	algorithm_time.start();
 *	AlgorithmPartA();
 *	algorithm_time.sample(part_a);
 *	AlgorithmPartB();
 *	algorithm_time.sample(part_b);
 *	@endcode
 *
 *	This would allow for completely disabling the timing, including the data.
